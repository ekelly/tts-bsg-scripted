Shamelessly stolen from https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=853230791

All credit goes to Flolania. I just tweaked a few things and fixed a couple bugs.


Notes (used to comprehend the source code):
- APC bag = Admiral, President, CAG
- TPLTPE bag = Treachery, Political, Leadership, Tactics, Piloting, Engineering bag

currentplayer = integer representing the index of the players
counter = integer. (Used for iterating through the players?)
Count = global variable that should be local. Used to determine how many cards are put on the crisis board
selectedplayers = ???

It seems like all the data is being 'stored' in the character cards.

Titles[1] = list of Tables
   - object["Data"] = Table
      - object["Data"]["PlayerPosition"] = index of the player
      - object["Data"]["PlayerColor"] = color of the player
      - object["Data"]["Hand"] = Hand Table?

Titles[1] = ???
Titles[4] = Cylon Leader

Calling Succession function passes EndSetup, which is a boolean to indicate whether or not setup has completed.


TODO: Try executing, see what happens.
