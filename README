Shamelessly stolen from https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=853230791

All credit goes to Flolania. I just tweaked a few things and fixed a couple bugs.


Notes (used to comprehend the source code):
- APC bag = Admiral, President, CAG
- TPLTPE bag = Treachery, Political, Leadership, Tactics, Piloting, Engineering bag

currentplayer = integer representing the index of the players
counter = integer. (Used for iterating through the players?)
Count = global variable that should be local. Used to determine how many cards are put on the crisis board
selectedplayers = ???
PlayerCounter = Combined Counter for number of players, number of non-cylon players, number of non-support / non-cylon leader players (for determining what classes are 'locked')

It seems like all the data is being 'stored' in the character cards.

NCharData = constant data representing the content of each character card

Titles[1] = list of Tables
   - object["Data"] = Table
      - object["Data"]["PlayerPosition"] = index of the player
      - object["Data"]["PlayerColor"] = color of the player
      - object["Data"]["Hand"] = Hand Table?

Titles[1] = Admiral Ranking
Titles[2] = President Ranking
Titles[3] = CAG ranking
Titles[4] = Cylon Leader ranking

Whenever you see a for loop like this:
`for y, test in ipairs(Titles[1]) do`
it's basically just relying on the fact that *everyone* has a character in the
    Admiral ranking, so it's really just iterating through the character Cards
    in admiral ranking order

Calling Succession function passes EndSetup, which is a boolean to indicate whether or not setup has completed.
However, the PrintSuccession button (which is what happens when you press the 's' on the game board) only prints the
  line of succession to a log. It does not move any cards or decks around.


GenerateCharaterButtons is spelled incorrectly


------------------------------
Data flow:

1. selecting the final 'next' button calls 'save' with the game configuration data
2. save calls GenerateCharaterButtons
3. GenerateCharaterButtons creates all the characters and populates them with buttons that call CardButton
4. CardButton associates the Character with the player, then attaches the data to the character card via setTable('Data')
5. CardButton also calls Characters()
6. Characters() ensures that each class type is locked when selected
7. Characters also counts how many characters were selected and sets EndSetup boolean
8. CardButton calls spawndrawcards to create the buttons on the character cards
9. CardButton relies on EndSetup boolean and calls Succession
10. Succession gets called. This inserts the character data into the titles list and sorts it
10a. It's unclear why Succession uses the 'execute' data
11. Succession calls BuildAPC() if the game is already setup
12. BuildAPC calls *all* the other setup methods, starting with BuildTPLTPE()

13. BuildTPLTPE() creates the skill card decks
14. BuildDestination() creates the destination decks
15. LoyaltyDeck() creates the loyalty deck and mutiny cards
16. BuildCrisisCards() builds the crisis card deck
17. BuildSupercrisisCards() builds the supercrisis deck
18. changeimg() creates the actual board, and the buttons on the board such as Resource tracking, jump tracking, destiny card building. It basically does *all* the game board setup
19. spawnships() generates all the ship tokens
20. spawncharacters() takes all the character cards out of the bag and places them, then sets the character data on the card

21. BuildAPC then sets a 10 second timer to shuffle all the decks (why 10 sec?)
22. BuildAPC sets currentplayer and counter
23. BuildAPC creates a "spawn crisis board" button and puts it on the 'TestingObject' (token)
24. ShuffleAll() shuffles all the decks then destroys all the bags used for setup

------------------------------
Dynamic data: - unsure if this needs to be tracked separately

- Which person is assigned to which characters
- Whether a character is executed or not
- Who has which title
- Which loyalty cards are in front of each player
- The state of all the trackers

------------------------------

Execute doesn't seem to allow you to reselect a character?
TODO: Try executing, see what happens.
